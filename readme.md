## About the developer: [Ashmit JaiSarita Gupta](https://jaisarita.vercel.app/)

I am an engineering physics undergraduate passionate about Quantum Computing, Machine Learning, UI/UX, and Web Development. About two years ago, when I first discovered the field of Web Development and Quantum Computing, it totally amazed me and I have been dedicating my education to them ever since. Over the past two years, I have dedicated a considerable amount of time and effort to learning and developing skills in these fields by taking various online courses, reading different articles, making several projects, and involving in various research internships and mentorship programs. Fast forward to today, I am currently working on a modern streaming platform and researching QUBO Relaxation Parameter Optimisation using Learning Surrogate Solver (QROSS).
