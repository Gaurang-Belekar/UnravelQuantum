**Title of the quantum algorithm you want to implement.**
A clear and concise title of the quantum algorithm you want to implement. Ex: Add demonstration for Quantum Support Vector Machine with IRIS Dataset

**Describe the quantum algorithm**
A clear and concise abstract of what you want to implement.

**Minimum required sections on the demonstration page**
This page should have:
- Demonstration (Users should be able to tweak options. Show the output circuit, measurement results, and histogram to the user.)
- Detailed explanation including mathematics and examples (wherever required) divided into multiple sections
